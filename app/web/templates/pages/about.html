                <p class="text-muted fs-5 lh-lg">
                    In 2004, a young Bhikkhu named Shripad made a profound decision to join the monk order, known as the bhikkhu sangha. At a tender age, he grasped the significance of education and embarked on a journey of studying, exploring, and traveling to foreign lands in search of a deep-rooted understanding of Buddhism. His quest led him to realize the urgency of reviving the lost Buddhist culture, prompting him to take action.
